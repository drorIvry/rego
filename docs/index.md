Rego is a 

- üî•  blazingly fast
- ü•á API first
- üåà lightweight
- üïú Task orchestrator

It is designed to allow asynchronous workloads to be deployed over Kubernetes with minimal effort, while also providing a management API that can keep track of progress and run history.


Star us on [github](https://www.github.com/drorivry/rego).

## Use cases

- Run async workloads that needs to be managed (or visible to) a UI
- Integrate non production-grade code (data scientist's R code for example) within your production environment in a contained way
- Use to run stuff periodically with run history


## Requirements


- **[Go](https://go.dev/)**: any one of the **three latest major** [releases](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release) (we test it with these).

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)**: tested on v1.24+
