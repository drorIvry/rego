Rego is a 

- üî•  blazingly fast
- ü•á API first
- üåà lightweight
- üïú Task orchestrator

It is designed to allow asynchronous workloads to be deployed over Kubernetes with minimal effort, while also providing a management API that can keep track of progress and run history.


Star us on [github](https://www.github.com/drorivry/rego).

## Use cases

- Run async workloads that needs to be managed (or visible to) a UI
- Integrate non production-grade code (data scientist's R code for example) within your production environment in a contained way
- Use to run stuff periodically with run history


## Requirements


- **[Go](https://go.dev/)**: any one of the **three latest major** [releases](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release) (we test it with these).

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)**: tested on v1.24+

## Installation

### Kubernetes

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drorIvry/rego/main/deploy/deployment.yml
```

### Helm

```sh
helm repo add rego https://drorivry.github.io/rego-charts/
helm install --generate-name rego/rego
```

### Installing the rego CLI (Recommended)
```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drorIvry/rego-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Quick Start

### Using the CLI

rego comes with a pre-built CLI to use rego

after installing the cli you can use the `rego` command to operate rego

test the connection 
```sh
rego ping
```

deploy an image:
```sh
rego run -i hello-world
```

a more complex deployment
```sh
rego run -d "$(cat << EOF 
{
  "image": "hello-world",
  "name": "test",
  "args": "[\"1111\", \"33333\"]",
  "namespace": "default",
  "execution_interval": 0,
  "ttl_seconds_after_finished": 10,
  "metadata": {
    "ttlSecondsAfterFinished": 10,
    "completions": 10,
    "parallelism": 10
  }
}
EOF)"
```

### Using the API

With rego you can use the API to create and run k8s jobs with a managed API.

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{"image": "hello-world"}' localhost:4004/api/v1/task
```

This will start a job on your k8s cluster that'll run the docker image [hello-world](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/)

the response will look something like 

```js
{
  "definition_id": "a36fbd9b-bf8a-4c59-94c1-9938b6707e8f",
  "message": "created"
}
```

we can use the definition ID to see the task's running status

```sh
curl http://localhost:4004/api/v1/task/a36fbd9b-bf8a-4c59-94c1-9938b6707e8f/latest
```

which will respond with

```js
{
  "ID": 0,
  "CreatedAt": "2023-04-02T11:53:08.2008054+03:00",
  "UpdatedAt": "2023-04-02T11:53:16.2032147+03:00",
  "DeletedAt": null,
  "id": "7eb53d97-7380-4e0b-82a6-b38fbf9119d2",
  "task_definition_id": "a36fbd9b-bf8a-4c59-94c1-9938b6707e8f",
  "status_code": 500,
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "image": "hello-world",
  "name": "test",
  "ttl_seconds_after_finished": 10,
  "namespace": "test",
  "args": "[\"1111\", \"33333\"]",
  "metadata": {
    "ttlSecondsAfterFinished": 1
  }
}
```

which indicates the success.
